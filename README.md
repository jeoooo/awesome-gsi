# What is Game State Integration?
---
Game State Integration (GSI) is a powerful feature that enables the sending of real-time updates of the game state to services, which can be harnessed to create applications that integrate deeply with the current state of the game.

Game State Integration is a powerful technique that allows games to provide real-time data to external applications, creating opportunities for enhanced user experiences, improved analytics, and innovative gameplay features.
